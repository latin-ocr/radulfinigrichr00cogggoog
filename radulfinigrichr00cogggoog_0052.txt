a mystery, to be solved according ιο the bias ot each writer. The account
given ιο us by Athanasius on the authority oi a certain Macaire, and in
which he is followed by most ecclesiastieal writern vis. that being compell-
edhy natural causes toretlre, he wes found dead-that he burst uundes
in the midst and all nir bouelt gusbed out-is suspicions on many
grounds. Firstly, because it is but another version of the death oi J udas,
which however wants the mystery, and is reconcileable to reason, it we
accept the statement by Luke (Acts l, 18) that he was tatally ruptured
by a tiolent sall. Secondly, because Athanasius, the great opponent of
Arius, recites at length, inhia epistleto Serapion, De morte Arii, the prayer·
ol Alexander, Bishop ot Constantinuple, on the Suturduy preceding the
Suaday on which An'us was to be received into the communion citha
church. Oi this prayer l quote only one passage, “ But it* thou wilt spara
thy church (and Thou wilt spara itt remember the words oi Eusebius, and
give not over thiae inheritance, 0 hurd, to destruction and contempt, and
take Arius out oi the way.”
