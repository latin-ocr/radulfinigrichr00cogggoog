The two chronicles first mentioued in this list, are
those which are printed lor the first time in this
volume. Pits says that the second ol them occurs in
a manuscript belonging to Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge. The treatise Super Leuiticam, he says,
is at New College, Oxlord, De rte Militari and De
triplici aiu dc. at Pembroke Hall‚ Cambridge. To the
Pantheologieoa he affixos the name oi Ralph arch-
deacon ol Gloucester, which makes it doubtful whether
this was not a different person from Ralph Niger,
who, as far as we kuoW, was never archdeacou ol
, Gloucester. The treatise De rebus gestis regis Jotannts
is merely a chapter out of the work ol Roger de
Wendover, and occurs in a modern MS. at Paris. The
Initia regis Hearici Tertii is probably of the same
kind, but Ι cannot speak with certainty.

the most important of them are the two historical
